  rdfs:comment "The 'Intelligent Energy Systems Ontology' (IESO) merges several domain and application level ontologies developed, imported and/or extended in the scope of the power and energy systems (PES). The objectives are: to represent the domain concepts, relations and properties; and to support the communications between the involved systems, applications, services, players and devices.\n\nExisting ontologies in the PES domain were analyzed in detail to assess their potential for reuse for the semantic representation of the different data model (e.g., SEAS, SAREF, and electricity markets (EM) ontologies developed previously by the team). IESO is publicly available to ease their reuse and extension to interoperate with MAS-Society simulation tools. The knowledge model is organized in modules in order to optimize their use."@en ;

  dcterms:description "The 'Intelligent Energy Systems Ontology' (IESO) is a knowledge model conceived and developed to represent the domain concepts and provide the means for supporting the communication between agent-based systems, applications, and services in the scope of the 'Multi-Agent Systems SemantiC Interoperability for simulation and dEcision supporT in complex energY systems' (MAS-Society) project.\n\nMAS-Society focuses on providing effective solutions to enable the widespread of Distributed Energy Resources (DER), namely Renewable-Based Generation (RBG), Demand Response (DR), Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and Electric Vehicles (EVs), enabling to catch their potential to increase the overall energy efficiency and economic and energetic sustainability. This is targeted through the implementation of a complete simulation infrastructure that combines several distinct simulators and systems directed to the study of specific problems in Power and Energy Systems (PES). The goal is to enable the joint simulation of multiple problems, enabling studying the problem as a whole in a realistic way. In this way allowing to assess the impact of different business, market and players’ models in the scope of Electricity Markets (EM) and Smart Grids (SG), as well as analyzing the outcome from alternative decision support approaches.\n\nMAS-Society conceives and develops an ontology-based knowledge model that represents the domain concepts, accounting for the considered business, market and players’ models. The ontology enables automatic reasoning to extract new knowledge. It also supports the communication between the considered systems and applications. Understanding the same language will enable those tools to register in a registration platform that will be developed in the project, and therefore communicate and interact with distinct agents, systems and applications.\n\nThe ontology-based knowledge model will also be used to represent the concepts related to the different considered devices (e.g. energy related devices in buildings and SG), which will enable the models and methods developed by MAS-Society to be validated through the integration in a GECAD/ISEP laboratorial platform, which will combine the simulation capabilities of the MAS society resulting from this project, with physical control of energy resources."@en ;
