The Prosumer owns the device and defers responsibility for controlling its flexibility to the Aggregator. The Prosumer has final control over its assets, which means the Aggregatorâ€™s control space is limited by the Prosumerâ€™s comfort settings. Hence the Prosumer is always in control of its comfort level; if the associated remuneration is high enough however, the Prosumer might be willing to compromise on its comfort levels.
