Justification:
	Physical solutions will affect the system SUSTENTABILITY.
	...

Objectives:
- Physically the project aims to reduce energy waste.
- Better distribution will allow lower waste affecting the value generated by [[Prosumers]].
- ...

Solutions (For the Grid):
- Adapt the energy connections to reduce waste.
- Use bi-directional energy networks for better logistics into physical energy trading.
- Use metrics such as the "[Voltage Performance Index](https://tecscience.tec.mx/en/science-communication/prosumers-renewable-energy/)" to control voltage quality in different points in the grid.
- ...

Solutions (For the householders):
- Indicate to [[Prosumers]] the usage of batteries to save energy not affecting the energy grid Voltage and transmission.
- ...
