Prosumers by concept are the entities part of the energy grid that can Produce and Consume energy to and from the grid, the junction of a [[Consumers]] and a [[Prosumers]].

Examples: Householders, Companies, Shops and etc.

They can be divided in 3 categories:
- Energy Buying Prosumer: Which is the prosumer that doesn't produce enough energy, needing for them to buy from the grid the necessary surplus.
- Stand-alone Prosumer: The prosumer that generates enough energy for its own use, but does not send energy back to the grid.
- Energy Seeling Prosumer: Capable of not only generate energy for its own use but to send back to the grid.

From the Prosumers capable of selling energy are also two categories:
- Prosumers capable of store energy in batteries, thermally or other ways.
- Prosumers not capable of store energy.
