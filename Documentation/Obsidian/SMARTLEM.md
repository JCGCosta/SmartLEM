Overall Objectives:
- 1 - Analyze existing techniques and methods applied to eletric markets trading.
- 2 - Identify current tools used to model the eletric markets.
- 3 - Evaluate requirements for the development of a platform for energy transactions.
- 4 - Map approaches that use ontologies in the eletric market modelling.
- 5 - Investigate existing studies using ontology techniques for developing metamodels in eletric markets.

Project Overview: 
	Dividing the problem between [[Physical]] and [[Virtual]], relies in the idea that the problem physically already exists, and those responsible for the grid should be already working into creating ways of not having higher Voltage values, or other problem in the energy net as they are responsible for the energy quality, to be more conclusive: [[Prosumers]], [[Producers]] and [[Consumers]] already exists producing and consuming energy, so it makes the physical problem part be more like a real-time producing and consuming logistic problem. Based on the manners of energy transmission quantities, usage and waste. Virtually otherwise we are talking about more like a virtual asset, were people can trade the generated value over the consumption or indeed with another strategy in a open market besides selling the energy to the grid. Merging those two things is impossible because of the laws of physics. But the interaction between physical and virtual environments will have to take in account the energy wasted, data that should be collected by the smart meters. 
	This division is part referenced in the [Open Energy Ontology](https://openenergyplatform.org/ontology/).

Questions:
- Why use ontology to model Eletric Markets? Having a ontology around Eletric Markets will enable the application of queries strategies to find patterns and transaction strategies for the virtual assets.
